# Multi-User Dungeon game

Part of the assessment for CS3524 Distributed Systems & Security. The game is a simple text-based RPG in which multiple people can partake in. There is a fixed amount of game instances that can be hosted on a server and multiple users can connect to server and join the various games on them. Users can also create their own game instances and limit their user count (so that potentially they can have their own single-player game).
